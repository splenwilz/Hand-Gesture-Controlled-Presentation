# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Presentation

Presentations are difficult to control. As you give your talk, it's hard to communicate with the media team without getting out of character and drawing attention away from yourselfâ€”even if you're using a teleprompter or presentation software that allows for prompters. And even if you can use those tools, there are still situations where they won't work well enough! 

In this project, we have built a system that lets you control your presentation using hand gestures instead of buttons. This system will: use computer vision to detect the user's hands and fingers in real time and use machine learning to recognize gestures, like pointing, drawing, etc using a neural network to translate the hand gestures into actions on your computer, such as moving to the next slide.

The ability to use hand gestures to control presentations would not only save you money, but it would also make your presentation more interactive.

How to use this Project

Installation

Download the zip file or clone this repository. using the following command 

git clone https://github.com/splenwilz/Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Presentation.git

This project requires 3 libraries to run, make sure python is installed on your machine. If you don't have python installed go to their official website or follow the link to download https://www.python.org/downloads/

Here are the libraries we'll

i. OpenCV

ii. cv zone

iii. NumPy

So we have to install using them, using whatever package installer you have, but I'll demonstrate this using pip one of the most common package installer

pip install opencv-python

pip install cvzone

pip install numpy

once you're done with the installation. 

Head-on to folder named 'presentation' and replace the pictures with pictures you'd be using for your presentation.

Run the Program and voila.

Happy Coding!
